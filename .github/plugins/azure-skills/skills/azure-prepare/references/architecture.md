# Architecture Planning

Select hosting stack and map components to Azure services.

## Stack Selection

| Stack | Best For | Azure Services |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Containers** | Docker experience, complex dependencies, microservices | Container Apps, AKS, ACR |
| **Serverless** | Event-driven, variable traffic, cost optimization | Functions, Logic Apps, Event Grid |
| **App Service** | Traditional web apps, PaaS preference | App Service, Static Web Apps |

### Decision Factors

| Factor | Containers | Serverless | App Service |
|--------|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Docker experience | ✓✓ | | |
| Event-driven | ✓ | ✓✓ | |
| Variable traffic | | ✓✓ | ✓ |
| Complex dependencies | ✓✓ | | ✓ |
| Long-running processes | ✓✓ | ✓ (Durable Functions) | ✓ |
| Workflow / orchestration | | ✓✓ (Durable Functions + DTS) | |
| Minimal ops overhead | | ✓✓ | ✓ |

## Service Mapping

### Hosting

| Component Type | Primary Service | Alternatives |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| SPA Frontend | Static Web Apps | Blob + CDN |
| SSR Web App | Container Apps | App Service |
| REST/GraphQL API | Container Apps | App Service, Functions |
| Background Worker | Container Apps | Functions |
| Scheduled Task | Functions (Timer) | Container Apps Jobs |
| Event Processor | Functions | Container Apps |

### Data

| Need | Primary | Alternatives |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Relational | Azure SQL | PostgreSQL, MySQL |
| Document | Cosmos DB | MongoDB |
| Cache | Redis Cache | |
| Files | Blob Storage | Files Storage |
| Search | AI Search | |

### Integration

| Need | Service |
|------|---------|
| Message Queue | Service Bus |
| Pub/Sub | Event Grid |
| Streaming | Event Hubs |

### Workflow & Orchestration

| Need | Service | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Multi-step workflow / orchestration | **Durable Functions + Durable Task Scheduler** | DTS is the **required** managed backend for Durable Functions. Do NOT use Azure Storage or MSSQL backends. See [durable.md](services/functions/durable.md). |
| Low-code / visual workflow | Logic Apps | For integration-heavy, low-code scenarios |

### Supporting (Always Include)

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Log Analytics | Centralized logging |
| Application Insights | Monitoring, APM |
| Key Vault | Secrets management |
| Managed Identity | Service-to-service auth |
